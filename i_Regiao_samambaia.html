            <h2>-Region’s history-</h2>
              <br>
                <p>Samambaia was created on October 25th 1989, with the objective of settling families from invasions and backyards, who came from 
                    different parts of Brazil to the Federal District. Through law n°49 and decree 11.291, it became the 12th Administrative Region 
                    of the city, and started to be urbanized.
                </p>
                <p>Three years after the first occupations, 3.381 houses were built for low income families, mainly public workers. Their own house 
                    was acquired with the support of the Housing System of Social Interest - SHIS through financing from the National Bank.
                </p>
                <p>In 1989 the city began receiving a great number of families searching for a home. Today Samambaia is one of the cities that most
                     grow in our capital city and in Brazil, looking for sustainable development and quality of life.
                </p>
                <p>The place chosen for the implementation of the city belonged to Taguatinga rural nucleus, formed by a group of farms which produce 
                    vegetables, fruits and flowers since 1958. Part of that space continued to be inappropriate, later, to allow Samambaia to grow,
                     preserving, however, Três Meninas farm, that became a important cultural and educational reference of the administrative region
                      by being transformed in the Parque Ecológico e Vivencial Três Meninas.</p>

                <p>Nowadays, Samambaia urban area is subdivided in residential blocks (QR), commercial streets (QN and QS), industrial sectors (QI)

                     long, with the rural area being 76,90 km² long, where there are several condominiums and farms that develop agricultural 
                     activities. Thus, Samambaia comprises 8.01% of the total population of the DF and is located 35 km from the center of Brasília.</p><br>
                <h3><b>CURIOSITY:</b></h3>
                <p>The city receives its name because of a stream that runs through the region, whose source is found just below residential blocks 
                    127 and 327 and where plants of the fern species were found in abundance.</p>

                <p>A law project, number 1980/2021, was sent to the legislative chamber, by the Federal District governor, Ibaneis Rocha, about the 
                    area destined to the Samambaia shopping mall. According to Terracap the project resembles the size of Brasília Iguatemi shopping
                     mall, which is located in Lago Norte.
                </p>
                <p>According to a research made about the needs of the residents of the city, between their requests was the need for the 
                    construction of a bigger shopping mall that was able to attend the needs of the community.

                <p>To the region’s administrator, Gustavo Aires, who has been searching for parliamentarians' support to the law’s project approval,
                     this would be a dream come true to the population and the government. “The main focus is on job creation. There would be about
                      2,000 open positions, which would further turn the local economy”. Aires Aires points out that Samambaia has a strong potential
                       for growth, so much that several construction companies are looking for the city to raise their projects. “The real estate 
                       issue is strong around here. I always go to launches of new buildings. The trend towards vertical integration is the new
                        reality at Samambaia”, says the excited administrator.

                <p>Samambaia Shopping has been in operation since June 2019 and combines characteristics of shopping mall retail and street commerce,

                <p>The Paróquia Santa Luzia or better known as “Igreja da Barca” is located at Quadra 304 in Samambaia Sul, DF. It was built in 1996
                     close to the release of the movie Titanic, for this reason many citizens, when looking at its different shape, soon make 
                     reference to it. According to the Italian priest Alberto Trombini, who created the project, the church is a metaphor for Noah's
                      Ark, built to rescue people's souls. In addition to the religious temple, the Santa Luzia nursery school was also built on the
                       site and serves children in vulnerable situations.

              <h3><b>-Oldest resident :</b></h3>
              <p>“I have lived in Samambaia Sul for 30 years. I arrived here in December 1991, I came to attend the eighth year of elementary school.
                 The city before had no basic sanitation, no infrastructure and much of it was without asphalt and education was precarious, 
                 Samambaia was a dormitory city, currently it is one of the most developed cities, structured, with a lot of commerce, banks, 
                 hospitals, universities and totally different schools than 30 years ago.
                </p>
              <p>I decided to stay due to the financial stability that I found (housing, job and family), I already worked in commerce. Many times 
                I thought about changing cities due to safety and tranquility, because as it grew a lot, it became busier and, in a way, more
                 dangerous.”
            </p><br><br>
              <h3><b>-Newest resident :</b></h3>
              <p>“I grew up in this city and I fell in love with it due to a lot of remarkable moments, most lived in my childhood. Which was really 
                fun, considering that a great part of the kids of my street played together. I like the structure of the city, the parks and plazas
                 too.
                </p>
              <p>I live in a block that isn’t very safe, but there are a lot of nice and caring people. Even with those security problems I don’t 
                intend to change cities, since it evolved enough and in it there’s everything I need. In my opinion, the best part is the cooking, 
                because there are delicious foods with an accessible price and a lot of diversity.”</p>
