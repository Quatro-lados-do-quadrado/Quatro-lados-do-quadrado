              <br>
                <p>The region began to be established in 1967, under the name of Setor Residencial de Indústria e Abastecimento (SRIA), with the 
                    objective of receiving workers from the Setor de Indústrias e Abastecimento (SIA), as well as residents of irregular occupations
                     and civil servants. Guará had as its first inhabitants employees of the Companhia Urbanizadora da Nova Capital do Brasil 
                     (Novacap), who built their own houses.                </p>

                  <p>The small village attracted attention due to the way it was built, through a joint effort system, even in the early years of 
                    the new capital of the Republic. Those interested in living there gathered in groups and built Guará I street by street. After 
                    each street was completed, a lottery defined who would have the right to which house. The task force began with QE 5 and 
                    continued with QEs and QIs 1 and 3. The agglomeration was named after the beautiful stream that bordered it and is one of the 
                    sources of Lake Paranoá, the Guará stream, which bathes the region, and originates from the Guará wolf, a common species in the
                     Brazilian cerrado. The word Guará derives from the Tupi auará, and means “Red” and is associated with both the Guará wolf and 
                     the Guará bird.
                </p>
                <p>The architectural design was done by the Housing Interest Society (SHIS), the construction material provided by the GDF (Federal
                     District Government) and the labor carried out by Novacap workers. The company's president himself, engineer Rogério de Freitas
                      Cunha, coordinated the task force. On April 21, 1969, the first section was inaugurated, called SRIA I, currently Guará I. In 
                      the same year, Novacap and s Shis expanded the occupation area, with the second section, called Guará II, inaugurated on March 
                      2 from 1972, with the aim of assisting lower-income civil servants transferred to Brasília along with the last ministries, in
                       addition to industrial and commercial workers, this time financed by the BNH (National Housing Bank).

                  <p>The official inauguration of that new satellite city took place on May 5, 1969, on that date Guará had 2,623 houses built and 
                    1,021 under construction. From then on, Shis began building another 3,000 houses, for government employees who did not have their
                     own homes. Along with the ones built in the joint effort, these more than six thousand houses formed the initial nucleus of 
                     Guará, occupying an area of ​​2,994 square kilometers. In 1971, Guará was expanded and now occupies an area of ​​8,100 square 
                     kilometers.
                </p>
                <p>And the region continued to grow a lot in the following years. The Feira Permanente do Guará (Guará fair), which we’ll discuss 
                    about later, already existed informally since 1969, and it was officially inaugurated in 1983.

                <p>In 1969, the Feira do Guará was created, it was made with the purpose of serving unemployed people who sold their goods in some 
                    stalls in front of Benecap, a government agency that belonged to Novacap employees. It's been here ever since, so it was 
                    necessary to keep up to date with the changes that come over time, after all, it went through decades and lasts until the present
                    . Nowadays it has Social Wi-Fi, which is a project that consists of providing free public access to the internet, via Wi-Fi 
                    signal, to citizens of the Federal District, in different places with high circulation of people, which was developed by the 
                    Secretary of Science, Technology and Innovation (Secti). It also has more than 600 shops of varied commerce, with around 50 
                    thousand people from Wednesday to Sunday.
                </p>
                <p>We can find among the products, clothes, accessories, foods of the most varied as fruits and vegetables, meats, cheeses, sweets, 
                    besides typical delicacies. It is noticeable the great cultural variety that exists in Feira do Guará, which has items from 
                    various regions of Brazil. Entrepreneur Sávio Kzam, who has been going to the place for many years and buys products for his 
                    ice cream place, which is very popular, points out: “At Feira do Guará, I find some typical products, such as tapioca gum, 
                    because I produce tapioca in my establishment”.</b></h3>
                
                <h3><b>-Parque Ecológico Ezechias Heringer (Ezechias Heringer ecologic park):</b></h3>
                <p>The Parque Ecológico Ezechias Heringer, also known as Parque do Guará(Guará Park), was conceived in 1960, with the aim of 
                    preserving the banks of the Guará stream that supplies Lake Paranoá. It was created and in the beginning it had the name of 
                    “Parque do Guará”, which is still called today by many, as previously mentioned. In 1977, it had its first regulation, but it was
                     only on January 13, 1998 that Law nº 1,826 was enacted, effectively creating it.</p>
                <p>Because it has typical Cerrado, murundus fields and dense gallery forest, the unit is endowed with great biodiversity, where, 
                    in addition to orchids, 51 tree species and 59 species of shrubs and herbs, including rare and almost extinct species, have 
                    already been found. The Pirá Brasília can also be found there, a rare fish from our biome that only exists in the swamps of the 
                    Federal District. The species was discovered in the 50s, during the construction of Brasília. For the administrator of Guará, 
                    Luciane Quintana, Ezechias Heringer Park is the city's green treasure, much frequented by the population. “The existence of 
                    important springs and biodiversity highlights it as one of the most important ecological parks in the DF.”, she says.

              <h2>-Testimonials from residents-</h2><br><br>
              <h3><b>-Oldest resident:</b></h3>
              <p>“I have lived in Guará since 1996, I came from Bahia and lived here with my husband, the first administrative region I lived in was 
                Guará and I am here until today.
              </p>
              <p>It is a region that has already evolved a lot and continues to grow. Over time I could see the changes that were happening, 
                improvement in the quality of study, housing conditions, etc. I have already worked in Guará and today I work both in Guará and in 
                the central area. Currently there is access to jobs in this administrative region, although many live here and work in Plano Piloto 
                using it as a dormitory town.
              </p>
              <p>It is a safe, peaceful place with many friends, with many squares and courts. I believe it is a good place to live, and I would not 
                move from here.” - Telma da Costa Lopes, resident of Guará for 26 years.</p><br><br>

              <h3><b>-Newest resident:</b></h3>
              <p>“My arrival in Brasilia was in September 2017, I came because of a promotion at work. At first I lived in Águas Claras, but I moved
                 to Guará due to the proximity to the Plano Piloto, since then I have lived in two blocks of Guará 1.</p>
              <p>I had a good first impression, a friendly neighborhood and a good place to live as a family due to the many squares located on the 
                blocks.</p>
              <p>Before living in the country's capital, the view that was passed was that the Federal District boils down to the Plano Piloto,
                 politics, 'the city of the corrupt', but when you get here, you can see that there is much more to it than that, there are more
                  stories to be told than that of Juscelino Kubitschek and the great and 'innovative' plan of 50 years in 5.
              </p>
              <p>The thought spread is that the only sights and landmarks are in the city idealized by JK, those designed by Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio
                 Costa, such as the Metropolitan Cathedral, the national congress, among others. </p>
              <p>I realized that there is much more, the city breathes culture and the arts in all its corners, it is pure poetry, the mother city of
                 the best rock bands in Brazil."- Emerson de Oliveira, 38 years old, resident of the region for 3 years.
