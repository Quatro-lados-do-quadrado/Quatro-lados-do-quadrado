            <h2>-Region’s history-</h2>
              <br>
                <p>Created in 1992, Santa Maria is the 13th Administrative region to be created in the Federal District, it has around 125 thousand 
                    inhabitants and it is composed of urban and rural areas.</p>
                <p>Its name comes from a river that can be found in the same place since its foundation. The region was batched to low income workers
                     who had come to build the capital city.
                </p>
                <p>Santa Maria is going through a growing process that is noticeable to the residents who time to time face a new building. That 
                    little city is falling behind for the rise of a new place.
                </p>

                <p>Another very important attraction that is present in the plaza is the holy mary statue, called santinha, a monument well known by

                    </p>
                <p>It is a tribute to the holy mother of god, region’s patroness, and its day is celebrated on January first, which is a holiday to

                <p>Lúcio Costa, Brasilia’s architect, thought the monument was weird though and he suggested that it was put in a very distant place.
                    And that’s how our little dearest Cifrudo (how the monument is called by the residents), appeared in Santa Maria.</p>
                <p>The sculpture measures 16 meters or 52 feet and it can be found near BR-040, it is a tourist attraction, where everybody who 
                    lives there already saw or heard about it, but not everyone knows its history.
                </p>
                <p>Nowadays the monument suffers a critic state of degradation, its only restoration was made in 1987, and it seems like 
                    it won't have another very soon.</p>

              <h3><b>-Oldest resident: </b></h3>
              <p>“I got here on 02/04/1992, I remember that there weren't any buses to come back home, we got the ones to Luziânia and got down 
                four stops before the ending and went walking home. I was 17 years old and I was pregnant with my first child. My sister won a batch 
                here and I came with her and my brother in law.Soon I fell in love with the place, because it reminded me of my small town. I had 
                just a few neighbors and all of them were very welcoming.
                </p>
              <p>There was no electricity, the houses that had it pulled it from the light poles in Alagados avenue by illegal connections called 
                cats. There was no sewer access and much less water, you had to get it from a water truck, and it only came 3 times a week.Even with
                 all that precariousness I fell in love with Santa Maria, to me being there was a fresh start.

              <p>Time was going by, the region was growing , what is today the block of houses 120/116 was back then part of the vegetation (Cerrado)
                , we went there to pick cashew, the blocks 300/400/500, were still farms, there hadn’t been batched yet.We were humble, but the 
                neighbors were united, and even with all the difficulties we were happy.We were growing along with Santa Maria, it started to show 
                up the first grocery stores, piped water, energy, asphalt.It was hard, there was criminality, but it wasn’t like it is now, we didn’t
                 see people using drugs in public. </p>
              <p>I remember that when it was a world cup year, the person with the biggest television opened the gates so that everyone in the street
                 could watch the match. In São João they adorned the streets, there was a fire pit, they roasted potatoes and it was great.South 
                 Santa Maria is older than North, but today North is more evolved. Another thing I remember are the rally parties in election years,
                  there were plenty of shows, KLB has already been here, Calypso, Gino and Geno, we watched them really close, you know?I still live 
                  here, the day I will be able to have my own house. I want it to be in Sant, because here is my ‘mother city’, it’s where I found
                   myself, had my daughters and am almost done raising them.</p>
            <p>Back then until today a lot of good things happened, but I also miss that time. Nowadays there’s the mall, a hospital, a police 
                station, but it’s also very dangerous. In the past the houses had no walls and nobody stole anything.Santa Maria is a region where
                 I have so many histories to tell, many conquers.And here it is, the city I love, still there is much to conquer, and I want to stay
                  here.” - Gelsa, 47 years old, resident of the region for the past 30 years.” </p>
                 <br><br>
              <h3><b>-Newest resident :</b></h3>
              <p>Since I was born I live in Santa Maria, the feeling I have about the region is very nationalist. I know there are better regions, 
                more developed, but it’s here that I found my home, where I know more people, I studied most of my life here, it’s where I come back 
                after a exhausting day.
            </p>
              <p>I love walking around here, going in the plaza, in the mall and mainly seeing the sunset and the birds. From time to time you’ll 
                find a macaw or a toucan around.
            </p>
              <p>Is a simple place, with people with lower class people, the neighborhood is friendly and the stores (which are in development) have 
                a lot of variety. The Monteiro Lobato library is huge and has a lot of books.</p>
              <p>Santa is divided in blocks and in north and south as well. As someone who lives in the North part of the region I have more property
                 to talk about, it is organized and at most it’s a clean and calm place. - Fernanda, 16 years old
